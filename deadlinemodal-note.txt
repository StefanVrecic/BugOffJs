DeadlineModal logic

duedate + description + severity + [ ] + (VIEW) // DONE

For all the items that HAVE dueDate and ARE NOT CLOSED and OVERDUECONFIRMED != true DONE

Sort them by dueDate DONE
Put the overdue first, then the upcoming next => seperate by time > now? DONE

Put the earliest at top // DONE
For over due items, if item.overdueConfirmed = true  => do not show DONE
Put the corresponding description and severity next to them // DONE
Provide a checkbox that allows a user to complete the task. If pressed, the card's status will be changed to ' CLOSED ' // DONE
Put a button next to it (view) that opens the MainModal (over top? unsure) // DONE


Link up the checkbox to send it to closed - (this.changeLane(id, 4)) 
// the status within the app does not normally change, only on the database. This should be implemented to fix the above line from not working

Link up the dynamically rendered button to setActiveCard = value
