work on 1 component and go through all the devices

iPhone SE + landscape
iPhone X
My phone
iPad 
iPad pro
laptop
Desktop

account - done
logout - done
confirm delete - done
deadline - done
trelloboard - functional but by no means pretty
sidebar - 
x button - okay
mainmodal - 

issues:
-opening deadline modal button from certain media queries
-logout is at bottom of sidebar
-exit (account, deadline, main, notes)
- if add card is open but somewhere outside is clicked, then add card should close => 
- would be ideal to have "goto" section for 1-lane on small devices
- reduce text area on open for certain devces
- could add the burger icon for the sidebar
- add a failsafe for the delete item handler - if no modalId registered => don't open

- on mobile (portrait) delete scroll from description and put in overall? => then need to expand height of description.
- tbh calendar is very problematic, especialy so in portrait

- padding  below delete item

- obviously testing with db
- calendar is transparent -- I think this is moreso from Chrome?
- dropdownbuttons misaligned (Se portrait)
- ditto + calendar (Se landscape)
-  =>  =>  => iPhone x seems okay (portrait)  => but landscape rhs overflows (and lhs edit a little) - 1024px query












media screen query boilerplate



@media screen and (max-width: 1400px) {

}

@media screen and (max-width: 1024px) {

}
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {

}
@media screen and (max-width: 576px) {

} 


@media screen and (max-height: 375px) {

}

/** iPhone SE landscape -- above styles apply!**/
