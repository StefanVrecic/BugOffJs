Main challenges I've experienced

Basic syntax errors with arrow functions mainly

Loading default values e.g., checkbox, dropdown etc required lots of work and checkbox doesn't even work correctly...

Removing event listener when unmounting child component would cause a re-render in parent thus re-creating child - need to think of a way to over come this

UI/design/CSS - the CSS and HTML were a massive PITA, I saved myself an hour or two by using a template for landing page, but then I didn't bother to understand it and I spent many hours 'guessing' how it worked when I resused components.
- Didn't set up modular CSS - bad choice. Limited understanding of how CSS attributes are applied causing lots of trouble. Responsiveness etc. List goes on.

Figuring out how to manage state with the cards and the TrelloBoard was quite tough and took me a long time to figure out.

I couldn't get the drag and drop logic to work for a long time.
